"# Raspberry-Pi-Robot-Car-with-Distance-Sensor" 

This is a robotic car project that i developed with Raspberry Pi 4 and Python. It can be control by keyboard and it measures the distance between the any object and itself and prints it to the screen with every push. I used GPIO library for accessing the GPIO logic pins on raspberry pi, to control the cars mobility. Also used Tkiner library to create a GUI to reach the keyboard for controlling cars direction for sure.
